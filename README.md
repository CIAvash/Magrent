Magrent is a Firefox add-on that enables you to convert magnet links and URIs to torrent files.
It uses torrent cache sites like Torrage.com for downloading torrent files.

This add-on is useful when you have the magnet URI and want the torrent file or when your are using sites like The Pirate Bay which only provide the magnet links.

Magrent has 2 context menu items and a widget which is accessible from the Add-on Bar.

"Download .torrent file" context menu item appears when you right-click on a magnet link; This item will download the torrent from torrage.com(if the torrent is available).

Clicking on the add-on's button(widget) will open a panel for coverting magnet URI to torrent file. It checks your clipboard content and if it recognized a magnet URI it will convert the magnet URI automatically and show the download links.

Download links are from Torrage.com, Zoink.it, Torcache.net and Torrage.ws.

"Open in Magrent panel" is another context menu item which opens the magnet link in the panel and shows its download links.

Notes
-----
* Torrents may not be available; More sources are provided so that you can try them if one source is down or doesn't have the requested torrent file.
* It seems if torrage.ws doesn't have the torrent file on its server, it redirects you to torrage.com.
